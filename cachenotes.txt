cache terminoloy
  block size: the exact number of bytes loaded into the cache from RAM upon a cache miss
  cache miss: the data being accessed by the program is NOT in the cache
  cache hit: the data being accessed by the program IS in the cache

example:
    for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        sum += array[i];
    }

When i==0 (i.e., the first loop iteration), array[0] is likely to be a cache miss.
If the block size is 16, then array[1], array[2], and array[3] will all be cache hits.
Continuing on, array[4] is likely a miss, followed by hits on array[5, 6, and 7]

Direct-mapped cache ... the "cache line" (i.e., the spot where the block goes in the cache is directly in the memory address)

cache line/index: the bits of the memory address that determine which location in the cache that memory address belongs to

cache tag: the remaining bits to the left of the index (i.e., higher order bits) that uniquely identify that block
